Goal: To create a public repository in GitHub for the qmd and pdf files
created in the previous assignment. In this repository, I need to utilize
the branching capabilities, issues features, commits, and pull requests.
I also need to create a README file as well as plans for both the repo and 
the quarto assignment.

Needs:
Public repository
Main and dev branch
Two issue tags
Commits and pull requests
README file
Plan for repo and quarto assignment
PDF for activity 14
QMD file for activity 14
