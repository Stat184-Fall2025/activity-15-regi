Goals: To create a qmd file to showcase my code for data wrangling
and the visualization creations from chosen assignments. My goal is to 
fix and polish the code from the armed forces, baby names, and box problem 
assignments, and create new visualizations when necessary. Once finished, I 
will need to implement this in a quarto document, with an appropriate YAML
header, section headers, narrative texts for my code, as well as a code appendix.
The document should be rendered into a pdf.

Needs: 
Armed Forces Data Wrangling code
Frequency table for armed forces
Baby names data wrangling code
Time series visualization for baby names
Box problem function
Plot using stat_function
Narrative texts
YAML header
Section headers
Code Appendix
