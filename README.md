# What the repo/project is about
This project was a portfolio of various examples of data wrangling
and coding visualizations in R for data analysis. The document was
created using Quarto and showcased visualizations as well as 
narrative text analyzing the data. 

The project consisted of three different subsections. 
1. Armed forces data. This consisted of cleaning and wrangling
armed forces data as well as creating a two way frequency table 
showing the relationship between sex and rank.
2. Baby names data. This consisted of filtering the babynames 
dataset and creating a time series plot showing the patterns in 
popularity of four chosen names.
3. Box Problem. This consisted of solving the famous box problem
by creating a function to calculate volume, then creating a plot 
showing the cut size that results in the maximum possible volume.

The qmd file for this project as well as the rendered pdf is stored
in this public repository. In this repository you can also find the
plans used to create this project as well as this repository. 

# Where the data come from (if applicable)
The armed forces section used data from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?gid=597536282#gid=597536282
as well as https://neilhatfield.github.io/Stat184_PayGradeRanks.html

The baby names section used the BabyNames dataset from the dcData 
package in RStudio

# What's the current plan for the project
The current project plan to create a quarto document for analysis 
has been completed. The next steps would be to focus on creating 
and organizing a public repository for this project.

# How the repo is organized
The repo uses a simple organization structure. 
All files will be found in the top level and without
any subfolders
